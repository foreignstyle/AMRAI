AMRAI (Advanced Music Recommendation AI)
 
 
As a music lover, I am excited to create an AI tool that can greatly enhance the music streaming experience. 
Therefore, while searching for fresh and unique ideas and ways to bring them to life, I would like to outsource some data gathering to users.


MAIN THESES:
1. It is important to have music associations contained in data for the following model training. For instance, if someone likes one artist and often adds to the playlist music of another, it is more likely that the other person would also love the music of the second artist. Developing and learning this deep "nearly-subconscious" connections are some key features of AI that I'm planning to create.
2. Every person's music taste is unique, as well as their experience and emotions while listening to it. Most music compositions are deeply connected to our memories, such as places, people, and events. That is why sharing your emotions in addition to the data would contribute even more.
3.	For every song, the following characteristics will be provided: acousticness / danceability / duration / energy /	instrumentalness /	key /	liveness /	loudness /	mode /	speechiness /	tempo / time signature /	valence /	target /	songtitle /	artist. These dataframes will be used as AI "navigation" system.


I may expand and edit main theses list. It's the first step towards creating something unique, I greatly appreciate your understanding.


Therefore, I would be grateful if you could share your music tastes in the discussions and maybe invite your friends! Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this project.


Thank you in advance, I value every contribution!
